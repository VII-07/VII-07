# Hi! I'm Bohdan 👋

### Full Stack Developer 🚀 | React · Next.js · Node.js · Nest.js · Express.js |Crafting Scalable Solutions ⚙️ 

I build web applications that don’t just *work* — they *feel right*.  
With 4+ years of experience crafting modern products for startups and growing teams,  
I work across the stack — from elegant, responsive interfaces to reliable, scalable backend systems.

### ⚙️ What I Do
- 💻 **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript — clean, maintainable, and fast UIs  
- 🧩 **Backend:** Node.js, Nest.js, Express.js — robust APIs, integrations, and real-time features  
- 🗄️ **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB — designing efficient data models and queries  
- 🧰 **ORM:** TypeORM, Sequelize — structured and scalable data layers

### 🧠 A Bit About Me

- Always exploring better ways to connect design, logic, and performance  
- Big believer that great code isn’t just written — it’s engineered to last  

### 🎮 Fun Fact
I once spent hours optimizing a feature that no one noticed —  
but that’s how you know it was done *right* 😄
